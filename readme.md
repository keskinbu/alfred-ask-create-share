#Description : 
###a simple list filter for various online web submissions including

- asking questions on stack overflow 
- creating threads on reddit on various subreddits
- asking questions on certain forums
- creating github repo / gist
- and any other web submission I personally use


It all goes into one list filter and from there on you can filter with a set of prefixes. More specifically : 

- **s:** prefix will filter for asking questions on any one of [stack exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) sites.
- **r:** prefix will filter for creating new threads on various [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) subreddits
- **f:** prefix will filter for asking questions on various forums like [Alfred Forum](http://www.alfredforum.com/)
- **g:** prefix will currently allow you to quickly create new repository or new gist
- **w:** prefix is for all *other websites* like creating new hacker news thread or new codepen

Enjoy!
